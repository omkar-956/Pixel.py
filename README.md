# PRODIGY_CS_02
# üñºÔ∏è Image Encryption Tool

This project implements a simple image encryption and decryption tool using Python's tkinter for the GUI and PIL (Pillow) for image manipulation.

## üìñ Overview

The Image Encryption Tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a specified encryption key. Encryption involves applying a mathematical operation to each pixel of the image, while decryption reverses this operation to retrieve the original image.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Select Image:** Allows users to choose an image file (supports .png, .jpg, .jpeg formats).
- **Encryption Key:** Users input an integer key for encryption and decryption.
- **Encrypt Image:** Applies encryption to the selected image and saves the encrypted version.
- **Decrypt Image:** Reverses encryption to retrieve and save the original image.

## üìö How It Works

The tool uses tkinter for the graphical interface. Upon selecting an image and providing an encryption key:
- **Encrypt:** Adds the key value to each pixel's RGB values modulo 256.
- **Decrypt:** Subtracts the key value from each pixel's RGB values modulo 256.

## üíª Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (typically included in standard Python installations)
- Pillow (PIL) library: `pip install pillow`

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   sh
   pip install pillow
   

3. **Run the Program:**
   sh
   python pixel.py
   

4. **Using the Program:**
   - Click **Select Image** to choose an image file.
   - Enter an integer **Encryption Key**.
   - Click **Encrypt** to encrypt the selected image.
   - Click **Decrypt** to decrypt the previously encrypted image.

## üìÇ Project Structure
